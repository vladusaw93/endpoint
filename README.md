# 🚀 Custom Endpoint Project

## 📖 Overview

This project provides a custom API endpoint to determine specific string values based on the divisibility rules of
numbers. Built using TypeScript, it offers a solid type system to ensure code reliability.

## 🔧 Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash npm install
   npm install

3. **Run the Project**

🌍 For development:
